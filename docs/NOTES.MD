# Why Rave Kult

Born from a frustration about the lack of a central place where i can find info about events and festivals that is complete, easily accesible and openly available. 
A protest against the closed-source approach of Facebook, Resident Advisor and other large (social) media providers.

RK wants to become the leading European content provider for music events and festivals within the sphere of electronic music by providing complete & high-quality events listing that are easily shareable and accesible from all platforms.

Our mission is to provide complete information to the electronic music and dance community in Europe, by connecting people, organisations and events throughout the continent.

## Other features that may be added;
- Organisation profiles to allow third-party creation of events
- Forum/ Chat functionalities
- Merchandising abilities / Shop
- Ticketing Services for organisations / possibly Ticketswap integration
