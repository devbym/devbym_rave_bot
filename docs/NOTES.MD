# Why Rave Kult

Born from a frustration about the lack of a central place where i can find info about events and festivals that is complete, easily accesible and openly available. 
A protest against the closed-source approach of Facebook, Resident Advisor and other large (social) media providers.

- Organisation profiles to allow third-party creation of events
- Forum/ Chat functionalities
- Merchandising abilities / Shop
