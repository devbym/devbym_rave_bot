# Why Rave Kult

Born from a frustration about the lack of a central place where i can find info about events and festivals that is complete, easily accesible and openly available. 
A protest against the closed-source approach of Facebook, Resident Advisor and other large (social) media providers.

Ravekult aims to become the most loved content provider for music events and festivals within the sphere of electronic music by providing complete & high-quality events listing that are easily shareable and accesible from all platforms.

Our mission is to provide complete information to the electronic music, dance and rave communities, by connecting people, organisations and events throughout the world.
